The exact mechanisms can be abstracted away from the user interface (the brake pedal). (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-abstraction-in-programming/

1. Greedy Algorithms are a powerful approach to solving coding challenges. These work by always choosing the ‚Äúlocally optimal‚Äù solution at each stage of problem solving ‚Äì regardless of the long-term consequences. For example, let's say I'm hiking in the mountains, and my goal is to reach as high an elevation as possible. I take the quick-and-dirty Greedy Algorithm approach of always hiking upward ‚Äì never downward. At some point I will reach a local maximum ‚Äì the highest point I can reach. And from that hill I will probably look over and see much taller mountains that I could have reached if I used a different algorithmic approach, such as Divide & Conquer or Dynamic Programming. This course will teach you how to code Greedy Algorithms in Python, and when to best make use of them. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-greedy-algorithms/
