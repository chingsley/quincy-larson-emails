1. freeCodeCamp just published a new Front End Development course. You can code along at home and build your own game in raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then you'll learn how to refactor your game to make use of the Model-View-Controller design pattern. You'll then add TypeScript to improve the reliability of your code, and React to make your game more dynamic. This is an excellent project-oriented course for beginners.

2. And if you want even more web development practice, here's another beginner's course. It will teach you how to build a personal website using a lot of contemporary tools, including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Sanity. Kapehe has taught a lot of courses with freeCodeCamp, and I think you'll dig her friendly teaching style.

3. You may have heard the terms “Symmetric Encryption” and “Asymmetric Encryption”. But what do they mean? This primer will teach you about these concepts, and how they power both the SSL protocol and its successor, TLS. Encryption makes the World Wide Web go ‘round.

4. And on the topic of encryption, it turns out that even something as basic as storing something safely on your computer requires quite a bit of applied mathematics. This tutorial on “encryption at rest” will walk you through some of the cryptography techniques developers use – including hashing and salting. Just thinking about those makes me hungry for some hash browns. (8 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/encryption-at-rest/

5. My friend Dhawal created this comprehensive list of 850 university courses that are freely available, which you can convert into college credit. There are a ton of different subjects to choose from, including Computer Science, Data Science, Math, and Information Security.

A quick note on GPT-4 and other Large Language Model (LLM) tools: I'm spending several hours each week practicing with these tools, and learning how to use them more effectively.

I still do all my writing the old fashion way. But I'm finding LLMs to be helpful in a lot of other ways, including simplifying my code.

Over the years, freeCodeCamp has published several courses on Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Linear Algebra, and other key concepts that power these new AI tools. And we're hard at work developing many more. We'll release these throughout the coming months, so stay tuned.

With all the courses freeCodeCamp publishes each week, you might be surprised to learn that we're just a tiny charity with a tiny staff of teachers. Thankfully, we have thousands of volunteers around the world. And we have thousands of people who donate each month to help us pay for servers. I encourage you to join these kind people and start supporting our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

1. The most dreaded part of the developer job search is the “coding interview”. This is where a software engineer asks you to solve programming challenges right there on the spot – often by writing code on a whiteboard.

Well, freeCodeCamp has hundreds of hours of practice challenges to help prepare you for this. And even better – we just published a course taught by my friends Kylie and Keith, who are both experienced software engineers.

This “Mock Interview” will give you a much better idea of what a typical coding interview process is like. Kylie takes on the role of coding interview candidate, and answers Keith's questions about Object-Oriented Programming, Dynamic Programming, and more.

2. Learn how to build a 3D animation that runs right inside a browser. You'll use React, WebGi, Three.js, and GSAP. You'll learn how to display 3D models on a website, animate them, and even optimize those 3D animations for mobile devices. Even though this may sound advanced, we made this course as beginner-accessible as possible. By the end of the course, you'll deploy your own 3D-animated website to the web.

3. Regular Expressions are a powerful – but notoriously tricky – programming tool. Luckily, ChatGPT is surprisingly good at creating these “RegEx” for you. In this course, freeCodeCamp instructor Ania Kubow will teach you how to build your very own RegEx-generating dashboard using the OpenAI API and Retool. (30-minute YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-chatgpt-to-build-a-regex-generator/

4. When I first learned Git, I struggled a bit with the concepts of local repository, remote repository, and how to sync code changes between the two. But you don't have to struggle. Deborah Kurata has created this detailed Git tutorial that walks you through Git's key syncing features. She also included lots of short video demonstrations. If you're new to Git, this is a good place to start. (30 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-and-sync-git-and-github-repositories/

5. freeCodeCamp just rolled out a major update to our Android app. You can now complete coding challenges right on your phone, with our smooth mobile coding user experience. And yes – we are working on an iOS version of the mobile app for iPhone, too. (5 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-mobile-app-curriculum-update/

As you may know, freeCodeCamp is a donor-supported charity. Thanks to our community of more than 8,289 supporters, we're able to afford the 106 cloud servers it takes to power our many open learning resources. If you're benefiting from freeCodeCamp, I encourage you to join us in our mission and become a supporter: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “A lot of developers don’t realize that the interviewer is there to help you. It’s their job to bring out the best in you. You should always be working with your interviewer to show them your skills, and make sure you’re going down the right path. When they ask you a coding question, here’s what you should do: clarify the problem with them, articulate your plan, and then talk them through your code as you’re writing it.” — Alex Chiou, Software Engineer and founder of Taro
