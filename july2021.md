Quote of the Week: “In many ways, Python is a dull language. It borrows solid old concepts from many other languages: boring syntax, unsurprising semantics, few automatic coercions. But that's one of the things I like about Python.” - Tim Peters, Author of "Zen of Python" and creator of the Timsort sorting algorithm
