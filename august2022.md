5. Have you ever seen a number followed by an exclamation point? In math, this is called a factorial. 5! is the number 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. In programming, if an algorithm has n! time complexity, it means it will be extremely slow and inefficient. Thankfully, you can almost always avoid this through more thoughtful programming. This quick tutorial will teach you a bit more about factorials, with some beginner JavaScript exercises for how you can calculate them.
