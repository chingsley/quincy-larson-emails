1. C is the most widely-used programming language in the world. Even when you're coding in Python or JavaScript, you're still using C under the hood. One key reason why C is still so popular 50 years after its creation is its high performance. C directly interacts with computer hardware. One way it does this is through Pointers, which point to the location of data in the computer's physical memory.

In this beginner's freeCodeCamp course on C programming, you'll learn about Pointers and key concepts like Passing By Reference, Passing By Value, Void Pointers, Arrays, and more. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/finally-understand-pointers-in-c/

This tutorial will show you how to generate boilerplate text, translations, and even code snippets. This is still the same old GPT-4, but you may find it convenient to access it right in your spreadsheets. (12 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ai-in-google-sheets/

5. A wise developer once said that there are only 3 hard problems in programming: Cache Invalidation, naming things, and centering elements with CSS. Well, I can't help you with those first two, but this guide will teach you everything you need to know about CSS spacing. You'll learn about Margins, Padding, Borders, Flexbox, Gaps, and the CSS Box Model. With some practice, you'll develop a keen instinct for how to create CSS layouts, so you can design elegant websites and apps.
