1. In this beginner course, you'll learn how to code your own 3D role-playing game. You'll use the open source Godot Game Engine to learn character creation, animation trees, inventory systems, and monster AI. This course includes all the 3D models and game environment assets you'll need to build the game. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-3d-rpg-game-with-godot/

2. And freeCodeCamp also published this advanced C# course. If you're already somewhat experienced with programming, and want to go deep on C#, this is the course for you. You'll learn about C# Delegates, Events, Generics, Asynchronous Programming, and Reflection. You'll also learn advanced LINQ and .NET concepts.

3. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are yet another tool developers can use to get things done. But one big limitation is that LLMs are pre-trained, and lack access to current information. That's where the new GPT Plugin ecosystem comes in. This tutorial will show you how plugins work so you can build one and fetch real-time data using APIs.

4. And if you're interested in LLMs, I encourage you to learn how to use LangChain. It's an open source Python library that breaks documents down into chunks and makes them easier for LLMs to search, analyze, and summarize. This tutorial will walk you through using LangChain and other libraries to create a Twitter bot that can generate text and reference up-to-date information, such as Wikipedia articles.

5. Even if you don't have a computer science degree, you can still learn computer science. This article will give you a broad overview of the field, and share some books and courses you may find helpful. They cover algorithms, architecture, operating systems, databases, networks, and more.

Quote of the Week: “I try to make a game that has beautiful open spaces, gaps, room for players to enjoy it in ways that were not authored. I never want it to be where you have to follow the rules completely, where you have to do things exactly as the designers intended.” — Hidetaka Miyazaki, developer, game designer, and creator of Dark Souls and Elden Ring
