Quote of the Week: “In terms of removing the socioeconomic barriers to Computer Science education, I am a huge fan of Quincy Larson and freeCodeCamp.org. When I'm hiring an engineer, I really can't tell if they learned something at college for $150K, or a paid boot camp for $50K, or freeCodeCamp.org for free.” — Mekka Okereke, a Director of Engineering at Google

By the way, next week is the Thanksgiving Holiday in the US. So I'll send out my next email on December 3rd. Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family.
