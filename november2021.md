1. If you want to get into DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering, or other cloud development fields, an AWS certification may go a long way. freeCodeCamp just published an in-depth course to help you prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. You'll learn cloud computing concepts, architecture, deployment models, and more.

2. Speaking of cloud development, manually deploying your codebase to the cloud several times a day can get tedious. If you learn how to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC), you can automate this process. Code along with this course and you'll learn the basics of IaC with Python, AWS, and the Pulumi open source library.

5. The freeCodeCamp community has grown a lot in 2021. How much? Today I crunched the numbers to find out. In short, people have used freeCodeCamp for more than 2 billion minutes in 2021 – the equivalent of 4,000 years. As you read this sentence, more than 4,000 people are on freeCodeCamp learning about programming and technology. And we've accomplished all of this on a tiny budget, thanks to a growing community of volunteers. This is my full annual report.

As I mentioned in my article above, freeCodeCamp has a proven track record of creating free learning resources for people around the world. Historically, each dollar donated has provided 50 hours worth of learning. If you want to get involved with our nonprofit's mission, we would welcome your help. We will put any funds you can give to good use: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-donate-to-free-code-camp/

Quote of the Week: “In terms of removing the socioeconomic barriers to Computer Science education, I am a huge fan of Quincy Larson and freeCodeCamp.org. When I'm hiring an engineer, I really can't tell if they learned something at college for $150K, or a paid boot camp for $50K, or freeCodeCamp.org for free.” — Mekka Okereke, a Director of Engineering at Google

By the way, next week is the Thanksgiving Holiday in the US. So I'll send out my next email on December 3rd. Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family. In the meantime, if you need more learning resources, there's an archive of each of these emails I've sent over the past 5 years (all 267 of them): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/quincy-larson-5-links-worth-your-time-email-full-list/
