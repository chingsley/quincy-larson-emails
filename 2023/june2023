1. C is the most widely-used programming language in the world. Even when you're coding in Python or JavaScript, you're still using C under the hood. One key reason why C is still so popular 50 years after its creation is its high performance. C directly interacts with computer hardware. One way it does this is through Pointers, which point to the location of data in the computer's physical memory.

In this beginner's freeCodeCamp course on C programming, you'll learn about Pointers and key concepts like Passing By Reference, Passing By Value, Void Pointers, Arrays, and more. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/finally-understand-pointers-in-c/

2. If you're wanting to earn professional certifications for your résumé or LinkedIn, this new freeCodeCamp course will help you pass the Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals Certification (PL-900) exam. You'll learn about Power BI, Power Virtual Agents, Power Automate, and other tools. freeCodeCamp now also has full-length courses on dozens of certifications from Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Terraform, and more. We've got you covered. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/microsoft-power-platform-fundamentals-certification-pl-900/

3. Did you know that – unlike other popular scripting languages – JavaScript is asynchronous? Thanks to non-blocking input/output, JavaScript engines can continue to receive instructions even when they're busy. But this is a double-edged sword. This in-depth tutorial will teach you how to use Promises and Async/Await techniques to harness the full power of JavaScript without creating a gigantic mess.

4. Not even spreadsheets are safe from Generative AI. You can now include prompts in Google Sheets and get GPT-4 responses right in the cells. This tutorial will show you how to generate boilerplate text, translations, and even code snippets. This is still the same old GPT-4, but you may find it convenient to access it right in your spreadsheets. (12 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ai-in-google-sheets/

5. A wise developer once said that there are only 3 hard problems in programming: Cache Invalidation, naming things, and centering elements with CSS. Well, I can't help you with those first two, but this guide will teach you everything you need to know about CSS spacing. You'll learn about Margins, Padding, Borders, Flexbox, Gaps, and the CSS Box Model. With some practice, you'll develop a keen instinct for how to create CSS layouts, so you can design elegant websites and apps.

1. freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive Computer Vision course. In this course, you'll use Python and the powerful TensorFlow library to diagnose Malaria, generate original images, and even predict human emotions from facial expressions. You'll learn about Vision Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, and a ton of other cutting edge computer science concepts. The only prerequisite for this course is some beginner Python programming skills, which you can also learn from one of freeCodeCamp's many open courses. Don't let yourself be daunted by all of this. You can do it. (37 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-computer-vision-with-deep-learning-and-tensorflow/

2. Rust is still one of the newer programming languages, but many codebases are already adopting it. Even the Linux Kernel now uses Rust. And Stack Overflow users have voted it the “most loved” programming language 7 years in a row. You can learn how to harness the raw performance power of Rust through this new freeCodeCamp Rust course. You'll learn about variables, functions, control flow, modules, and even closures. Enjoy.

3. Learn the key Design Patterns that power massive distributed systems. This new book by an experienced back-end developer will teach you the fundamental challenges of distributing work across many data centers around the world. In this intermediate software engineering book, you'll learn more than a dozen Design Patterns including the Saga Pattern, the Split Brain Pattern, and my personal favorite, the Sidecar Pattern. Who doesn't love sidecars? (full book - 2 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/design-patterns-for-distributed-systems/

4. This new book from the freeCodeCamp community will guide you through three popular JavaScript front-end development tools: Angular, Vue.js, and React. Each of these tools can be used to accomplish similar goals, but you only need one of them. So which one should you use for a given project? This book will help you decide. It will walk you through code examples for each of these tools, so you can understand their relative strengths and weaknesses. (full book - 2 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/front-end-javascript-development-react-angular-vue-compared/

5. When you're doing front-end development, there are so many ways you can style your React components. You could use CSS preprocessors, component libraries, or just plain-vanilla CSS. This quick tutorial will give you some code examples of the most common approaches, and share the pros and cons of each. (12 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-style-a-react-app/

I hope you're enjoying these new books and courses as much as I am. All of us at freeCodeCamp are working hard to create open learning resources that teach all of these new tools. We want to put this knowledge and this power into the hands of everyone, regardless of their financial situation.
