1. Python is one of the most widely used programming languages on Earth right now. In science, in industry, and in high school robotics clubs around the world. You, too, can learn to wield this mighty Python power. I'm sick as a dog as I type this, so if what I'm saying sounds silly, it's probably the NyQuil talking. freeCodeCamp has published dozens of Python video courses, but this week I wanted to share something for the folks who prefer good old fashion book learning. (full-length book): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-book/

2. Ah. Graph Algorithms. The bane of every coding interview prepper. These powerful programming patterns are over-represented in job interview questions, so you'll want to eventually learn them well. This course will help you grok Depth-First Traversal, Breadth-First Traversal, Shortest Path, and Dijkstra's Algorithm. This Dijkstra guy, he's kind of a big deal. More on him later. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-how-graph-algorithms-work/

3. User Interface VS User Experience – what's the difference, you might ask? Well, User Interfaces have been around since the industrial revolution. Think the control room of a power station, or the cockpit of a plane. But User Experience – that's a more recent way of thinking about Human-Computer Interaction. The term was coined in the 1990s by a designer and cognitive psychologist at Apple. This tutorial by freeCodeCamp instructor Dionysia Lemonaki will explain the distinctions between the two and their shared history. She'll also walk you through the UX Design Process.

4. Without computer networks, I'd need to put on my sneakers and run this letter to your door. Or bankrupt our charity buying postage stamps. Over the past 30 years, networks have changed almost everything about talking, learning, and getting things done. They are worthy of your attention and your respect. So learn a bit more about how they work. This tutorial will walk you through 5 of the most important layers – from the physical hardware all the way up to the applications running on top of all that sweet, sweet abstraction.

Quote of the Week (from the man himself, and apt given we started developing our computer science degree last year): “Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.” — Edsger Dijkstra, Mathematician, Computer Scientist, Turing Award Winner, and fellow Texan (I live in Texas if you didn't know that. Nevermind. I'm not the important one here.)

Quote of the Week: “In C, there's no magic. If you want something to be somewhere in memory, you have to put it there yourself. If you want a hash table, you have to implement it yourself. The result by term's end, we hope, is that students understand how things work from the bottom up and, better yet, can explain as much.” — David J. Malan, the Computer Science professor who teaches Harvard CS50

1. DevOps engineers help software run at massive scale. The field of DevOps combines programming – the Dev part – with system administration – the Ops part. It is a highly specialized – and high-paying – field to go into. This course for intermediate learners will teach you two of the most widely-used DevOps tools: Docker and Kubernetes. You'll learn about Containers, Microservices, Persistence, Observability, and more. With these in your toolbox, you'll be able to efficiently scale your apps, websites, and APIs to millions of users.

2. Do you remember those old clickety-clackety arrival-departure schedule boards? The kind you might see in a train station or an airport? In this JavaScript course for beginners, you'll code one of those. And you'll code that same flight widget in three ways: with plain-vanilla JS, with a REST API, and with a database. Along the way, freeCodeCamp teacher Ania Kubów will teach you a ton about full-stack development.

3. Big O Notation is a tool that developers use to understand how much time a piece of code will take to execute. Computer Scientists call this "Time Complexity." This comes up all the time in day-to-day programming, and in job interviews. As a developer, you will definitely want to understand Big O Notation well. And that's precisely why freeCodeCamp engineer Joel Olawanle wrote this Big O cheat sheet for you, complete with code examples. You can bookmark it, then refer to it when you need to calculate the Time Complexity of your code. (18 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-cheat-sheet-time-complexity-chart/

Quote of the Week: “I hooked a neural network up to my Roomba. I wanted it to learn to navigate without bumping into things, so I set up a reward scheme to encourage speed and discourage hitting the bumper sensors. It learnt to drive backwards, because there are no bumpers on the back.” — Custard Smingleigh, Developer and Roboticist
