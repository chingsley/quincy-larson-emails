1. If you're interested in Data Science and Machine Learning, I recommend this new intermediate-level Python course taught by MIT grad student Kylie Ying. You can code along at home in your browser. You'll use TensorFlow to train Neural Networks, visualize a diabetes dataset, and perform Text Classification on wine reviews. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/text-classification-tensorflow/

2. And if you're relatively new to Data Science, this tutorial will give you a gentle introduction to a lot of key Statistics concepts and terminology. This will make it easier for you to understand more advanced articles about Data Science, Machine Learning, and Scientific Computing in general.

3. What is CRUD? You may have heard the term “CRUD app” before to describe a website. It stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete – the 4 essential operations you can do with data. These are what separate a modern website with “dynamic” functionality from the “static” websites pioneered in the 1990s. This short article will explain how these 4 operations power so many dynamic websites. (6 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crud-operations-explained/

4. How to solve the Parking Lot Challenge in JavaScript. You'll use Object-Oriented Programming to build a parking lot that you can fill with cars. Mihail originally created this for his 5 year old daughter to play, but you can learn from it too. (12 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/parking-lot-challenge-solved-in-javascript/

5. PDF files are great for certain types of documents. But they can be hard to work with as a developer. This tutorial will give you an overview of popular libraries for working with PDF files. Then it will show you how to extract pages from a PDF and render them using JavaScript. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/extract-pdf-pages-render-with-javascript/

It costs quite a bit to run a website like freeCodeCamp.org – with thousands of programming and computer science courses. Please help us cover the cost of running our 100+ servers around the world. Thanks for supporting our charity's mission 🙂 https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

1. Greedy Algorithms are a powerful approach to solving coding challenges. These work by always choosing the “locally optimal” solution at each stage of problem solving – regardless of the long-term consequences. For example, let's say I'm hiking in the mountains, and my goal is to reach as high an elevation as possible. I take the quick-and-dirty Greedy Algorithm approach of always hiking upward – never downward. At some point I will reach a local maximum – the highest point I can reach. And from that hill I will probably look over and see much taller mountains that I could have reached if I used a different algorithmic approach, such as Divide & Conquer or Dynamic Programming. This course will teach you how to code Greedy Algorithms in Python, and when to best make use of them. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-greedy-algorithms/

2. As you may have heard, the freeCodeCamp community recently redesigned our entire Responsive Web Design certification. It now contains 1,000+ additional coding challenges. And Jessica just published this step-by-step strategy guide. You can reference this while you blaze through the first project, where you'll code your own cat photo app. (30 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-responsive-web-design-study-guide/

3. Terraform is an open source Infrastructure-as-Code tool. It helps you write code that will spin up cloud servers and other cloud services. This saves you the hassle of manually configuring them each time you want to deploy. This course will teach you how to use Terraform and Azure to build your own development environment. You'll learn about subnets, security groups, and The Provisioner – and no, that is not a WWE villain. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-terraform-and-azure-by-building-a-dev-environment/

4. Code your own customer support dashboard for your small business or startup. This course is taught by freeCodeCamp instructor Ania Kubów. She'll show you how to use the Discord API, SMTP email APIs, MongoDB, and Appsmith to build this in the cloud. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-low-code-dashboard-for-your-startup/

5. React is a powerful front-end JavaScript library. But did you know you can also use it to code your own command line applications? This tutorial will show you how to build your own CLI app that runs in your terminal. You'll learn how to use React along with the popular Ink library. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-js-ink-cli-tutorial/
