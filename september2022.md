3. freeCodeCamp also just published a full-length Java Programming Handbook to help beginners get started. You'll learn about the Java Virtual Machine, Java IDEs, Data Types, Operators, and more. This should serve as an excellent resource for you over the coming years, so I encourage you to read some of it and bookmark it as a reference.

4. With Windows Subsystem for Linux, you can now use Linux right inside Windows on your PC. This said, many developers prefer to dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux on the same computer. This tutorial will walk you through dual-booting best practices, so you can have the best of both worlds, Captain Picard style.

5. September is World Translation Month. And the freeCodeCamp community is kicking our translation effort into high gear. If you or your friends grew up speaking a language other than English, I encourage you to get involved. We have more than 9,000 English-language coding tutorials. And we want to make them easier to understand for folks less comfortable reading English. We have powerful software to help you make the most of any time you're able to volunteer.

And speaking of translation, our charity now has more than a dozen staff who are working to make these learning resources available in more world languages. Spanish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Korean, Bengali – we are just getting started. We also have 106 servers around the world helping more than 1 million visitors each day. It takes a lot to keep this engine running. If you're in a position to contribute, we will put your donations to good use: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate
