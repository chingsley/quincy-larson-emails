Here are this week's five links that are worth your time:

1. These days you can code right in your browser on sites like freeCodeCamp.org. But if you have never coded on your own computer before, this course will help you install Python and a code editor so you can start programming offline. Jabrils, a self-taught game developer, will teach you basic Python data structures, algorithms, conditional logic, and more.

Quote of the Week: “Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they do, and will do it better.” — Donald Knuth, Mathematician and Computer Scientist

Quote of the Week: This is an alternative way of thinking about Big O Notation, from Tennessee-based cloud engineer Josh Carroll.
O(1) = O(yeah)
O(log n) = O(nice)
O(n) = O(ok)
O(n²) = O(my)
O(2ⁿ) = O(no)
O(n!) = O(mg!)
