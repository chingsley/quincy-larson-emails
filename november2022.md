1. freeCodeCamp just published a hands-on Microservice Architecture course. This is a great way to learn about Distributed Systems. You can code along at home, and build your own video-to-MP3 file converter app. Along the way, you'll learn some MongoDB, Kubernetes, and MySQL. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/microservices-and-software-system-design-course/

2. TypeScript is like JavaScript, but with static types. For each variable, you specify whether it's a string, integer, boolean, or other data type. If you already know some JavaScript, TypeScript may not take that much time to learn. And it can reduce the number of bugs in your code. freeCodeCamp has converted almost our entire codebase to use TypeScript. It still has all the power of JavaScript, but it's now a bit easier for us to build new features. This beginner course will teach you everything you need to get started coding TypeScript.

3. Testing is a vital part of the software development process. You want to ensure that all your app's features work as intended. Thankfully, there are some powerful tools out there to help you write robust tests. This handbook will teach you how to code the most fundamental type of test: unit tests. It will also show you some web development best practices for using Jest and the React Testing Library.

4. Learn CSS and Responsive Web Design for beginners. Jessica's new guide will walk you through one of freeCodeCamp's most popular projects: coding your own café menu. She'll show you how to build it step-by-step. You can do this entire project on freeCodeCamp's core curriculum interactively, and reference Jessica's article when you get stuck or just need additional context.

5. Also, freeCodeCamp just published a massive Bootstrap course in Spanish, where you'll code your own portfolio. (We've also published several Bootstrap courses in English, too). If you have Spanish-speaking friends who want to learn web development and design, please tell them that we now have in-depth courses on a broad range of coding topics. These are all taught in Spanish by Estefania. She's an experienced teacher and software engineer.

Quote of the Week:

“The Evolution of Software Architecture:
1990s: Spaghetti-Oriented Architecture (AKA Copy & Paste)
2000s: Lasagna-Oriented Architecture (AKA Layered Monolith)
2010s: Ravioli-Oriented Architecture (AKA Microservices)
What's next? Probably Pizza-Oriented Architecture.”
