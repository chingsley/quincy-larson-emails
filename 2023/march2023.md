Quote of the Week: “I think that in life, as in game design, you have to find the fun. There is joy out there waiting to be discovered, but it might not be where you expected.

You can’t decide what something’s going to be before you embark on it, and you shouldn’t stick with a bad idea just because you’re fond of it. Take action as quickly and repeatedly as possible. Take advantage of what you already know. And take liberties with tradition.

But most importantly, take the time to appreciate the possibilities, and make sure all of your decisions are interesting ones.” — Sid Meier, game developer and creator of the Civilization game series

This week marks exactly 6 years since I started sending these “five links worth your time”. It's hard to believe I've sent more than 333 of them. (I only take off the last week of the year). You can browse the entire history of these on GitHub. And you can encourage your friends to start receiving these by updating their freeCodeCamp settings: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/quincy-larson-5-links-worth-your-time-email-full-list/

As you may know, freeCodeCamp is a public charity. There are no venture capitalists to tell us what to do. Just a small team of teachers and a massive community of volunteer contributors. I donated all my stock to the charity when we received tax-exempt status. So technically, you own as much of freeCodeCamp as I do – or anyone else does, for that matter. So treat freeCodeCamp like you own it, and support it. It helps us keep creating these open source learning resources. More than 8,334 kind people supported us this month, and you can to: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “The reason an experienced engineer moves so much faster than a beginner is because they've opened most of the “doors” they encounter in code thousands of times before. They stop to think, but so much is done purely by recall. This is why you need to practice, practice, practice.” — Dan Abramov, JavaScript Developer and Creator of Redux

1. You may have heard about AIs that can beat the world's best Chess players, Go players, and even Starcraft players. Many of these AIs use a game-playing algorithm called AlphaZero. The AI starts out by playing a game against itself to learn the rules and discover strategies. After a few hours of training, it's often able to play the game at a superhuman level. This Python course will teach you how to code your own AlphaZero algorithm from scratch that can win at both Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4. You'll learn about Monte Carlo Tree Search, Neural Networks, and more. This is an ideal course for anyone who wants to learn more about Machine Learning.

Quote of the Week: “AlphaGo's way is not to make territory here or there, but to place every stone in a position where it will be most useful. This is the true theory of Go: not ‘what do I want to build?’, but rather ‘how can I use every stone to its full potential?’” — Professional Go player Fan Hui after losing 5 games to AlphaGo, an AlphaZero algorithm trained to play the ancient strategy game of Go
