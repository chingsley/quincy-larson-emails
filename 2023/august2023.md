1. freeCodeCamp has partnered with Harvard to bring you another mind-expanding CS50 course: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. You'll get broad exposure to Machine Learning theory: Optimization, Classification, Graph Search Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, and more. You can code along at home and implement your own basic AIs using Python. This is a full university course that's completely self-paced and freely available. Enjoy.

2. freeCodeCamp also published an end-to-end testing course. You'll learn QA Engineering with the powerful Cypress JavaScript library. Some of the concepts you'll pick up include Assertions, Command Chaining, Intercepts, and Multi-Page Testing. Every developer should be able to double as their own QA engineer, and to write their own tests. This course will show you how.

3. Like any good board game, JavaScript is easy to learn and hard to master. And in this advanced JS course, freeCodeCamp instructor Tapas Adhikary will teach you a wide range of function concepts. You'll learn about the Call Stack, Nested Functions, Callback Functions, Higher-Order Functions, Closures, and everyone's favorite: Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions – also known as IIFE's (pronounced "iffy"). Put on your learning cap. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mastering-javascript-functions-for-beginners/

4. Learn JavaScript by reverse-engineering your own JS utility library – like the ever-popular Lodash library. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to hand-implement more than a dozen array methods, object methods, and math methods. This is excellent practice for brushing up on your JavaScript knowledge. And a lot of the code you write may make it into your other codebases. (45 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-javascript-utility-library-like-lodash/

5. When it comes to deploying your apps to production, there are a ton of options – many of which don't cost a thing. freeCodeCamp contributor Ijeoma Igboagu compares several hosting platforms including Vercel and Netlify, and shares the strengths and weaknesses of each. She also shows you how to deploy to these services using Git. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-websites-and-applications/

It's been an amazing week for learners everywhere. And the freeCodeCamp community is just getting started. I have so many more in-depth courses planned for the final 143 days of 2023.
