1. The first time I used ChatGPT, I was impressed. But I didn't yet realize how useful it would become in my day-to-day work as a developer. Only after I learned some Prompt Engineering techniques did I get good at communicating with the AI. Now I'm much more effective at getting Large Language Models to do tasks for me. That's why I'm excited to share this new freeCodeCamp course on Prompt Engineering. Ania Kubów will teach you techniques like Few-Shot Prompting, Vectors, Embeddings, and how to reduce AI hallucinations. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-prompt-engineering-full-course/

2. If you're brand new to HTML and CSS, this is the book for you. You'll learn about HTML, the skeleton of a webpage. You'll learn about CSS, the skin of a webpage. You'll even learn a little about JavaScript, the muscles of a webpage. Sprinkle in some DevTools and HTTP requests. Now you've got a proper web dev primer. Enjoy the book, and bookmark it for future reference as well. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-css-handbook-for-beginners/

3. Code your own cloud storage app using contemporary web development tools. This course will teach you how to use TypeScript – a version of JavaScript where all your variables are statically typed. This reduces bugs. You'll also use Next.js, a powerful front end framework. Then you'll layer on Tailwind CSS, a popular library for styling your user interface components. Finally, you'll learn how to use Firebase 9 to store your data.

4. New developers often ask me how they can get some practical experience writing software. My answer: contribute to open source projects. There are thousands of software engineers out there who will review your work and give you feedback. Some of your code may even make it into production, where many people will benefit from it. Each open source contribution you make to a project like freeCodeCamp is a feather in your cap. And this book will show you how to get started with open source.

5. How do you filter the signal from the noise? Why, through Signal Processing. This is the set of techniques that engineers have used for decades to make clearer television signals, phone calls, and even medical diagnostic images. This tutorial will bring you up to speed on Signal Processing and Fast Fourier Transforms, which underpin many file compression algorithms. You'll also learn about Causality, Linearity, and Time-invariance. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/signal-processing-and-systems-in-programming/

Also be sure to tell your Spanish-speaking friends that freeCodeCamp has a ton of courses in Spanish, including this new web dev course for beginners where you code your own Pokémon pokédex: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-css-and-javascript-project-in-spanish-create-a-pokedex/

We're also working hard to translate the freeCodeCamp curriculum into other world languages, including Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, and Ukrainian. You can support our charity and our localization efforts. Help us make these open learning resources available in even more languages: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate/

1. I'm excited to announce that freeCodeCamp has teamed up with Microsoft to bring you a freely available professional certification: the Foundational C# Certification. If you're interested in learning some C# and having a credential to put on your LinkedIn or CV, this program is for you. You'll complete 35 hours of training, then take an 80-question exam. We provide all the preparation materials, including a 90-minute video walk-through of the cert program. (free verified professional certification from Microsoft): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-microsoft-c-sharp-certification/

2. There are so many powerful AI tools out there, such as GPT-4. But what if you don't use tools. What if you build your own AI from scratch, using a “no black box” method? This course from Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor, who teaches computer science in Finland, will show you how to design such a system. You'll code an AI that can recognize and classify drawings. If you draw a fish, your AI will learn to recognize it as a fish. This is an excellent Machine Learning fundamentals course for any dev with some JavaScript knowledge and a bit of curiosity. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-machine-learning-and-neural-networks-without-frameworks/

3. This week, freeCodeCamp published The C Programming Handbook. It will teach you the basics of coding in C, one of the oldest and most important languages. You can read the entire book in your browser, and bookmark it for future reference. The book covers Data Types, Operators, Conditional Logic, Loops, and more fundamental coding concepts. Time spent improving your C is never wasted. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-c-programming-handbook-for-beginners/

4. And we also published a handbook on Agile Software Development methodologies. You'll learn about the Agile Manifesto and how it spawned a smörgåsbord of approaches to building projects. You'll read about Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, and how to ship features at scale. If you want your team to benefit from some of these concepts, this book is an excellent place to get started. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/agile-software-development-handbook/

5. 20 years ago, a few developers sat down to catalog the most common security issues they were discovering on the web. And from that, the OWASP Top 10 emerged as a popular reference for devs. You can use OWASP as a checklist to ensure a baseline level of security in your apps. This course will teach you how to spot these common pitfalls and avoid them in your projects. (90 minute YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/owasp-api-security-top-10-secure-your-apis/

Finally, I'm thrilled to introduce you to freeCodeCamp Press. These past few months, we've worked with developers from around the world to publish dozens of full length books and handbooks. Our goal is to share these tomes of wisdom with devs everywhere. You can bookmark these books to serve as a reference as you continue to expand your programming skills: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-press-books-handbooks/

Even though more than a million people use freeCodeCamp each day, only a small minority of people support our mission directly. I'm doing my best to try and change that. You can help by becomming a supporter and joining the 7,996 kind people who donate to our charity: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate
