1. freeCodeCamp just published a course that will teach you how to code your own API using Python. APIs are like websites designed for other computers to understand, rather than humans. Instead of sharing text, images, videos – and other media that humans understand – APIs just share raw data, such as JSON responses. This course will show you how to build your own REST API using the popular Python Django REST framework.

4. Have you ever wondered why we write it “freeCodeCamp” with a lowercase f? That's because we thought it would be funny to use Camel Case like JavaScript does for its variables. And this is just one style of cases that developers use. This guide will introduce you to other popular styles of writing variable names, including Snake Case, Pascal Case, and even Kebab Case.

5. 2022 has been a colossal year for the freeCodeCamp community. People spent more than 4 billion minutes learning on freeCodeCamp this year. I wrote this article about some of the areas we've been focused on expanding. Not just the university degree program, but also our massive translation efforts. You can check out some of the numbers for yourself. (5 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-2022-usage-statistics/
