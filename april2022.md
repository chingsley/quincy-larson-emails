Quote of the Week: “One of the reasons I enjoy working with Go is that I can mostly hold the spec in my head. And when I do misremember parts, it’s a few seconds' work to correct myself. It’s quite possibly the only non-trivial language I’ve worked with where this is the case.” — Eleanor McHugh, a software engineer who's worked on avionics and satellite communication
