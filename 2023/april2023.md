1. The most dreaded part of the developer job search is the “coding interview”. This is where a software engineer asks you to solve programming challenges right there on the spot – often by writing code on a whiteboard.

Well, freeCodeCamp has hundreds of hours of practice challenges to help prepare you for this. And even better – we just published a course taught by my friends Kylie and Keith, who are both experienced software engineers.

This “Mock Interview” will give you a much better idea of what a typical coding interview process is like. Kylie takes on the role of coding interview candidate, and answers Keith's questions about Object-Oriented Programming, Dynamic Programming, and more.

2. Learn how to build a 3D animation that runs right inside a browser. You'll use React, WebGi, Three.js, and GSAP. You'll learn how to display 3D models on a website, animate them, and even optimize those 3D animations for mobile devices. Even though this may sound advanced, we made this course as beginner-accessible as possible. By the end of the course, you'll deploy your own 3D-animated website to the web.

3. Regular Expressions are a powerful – but notoriously tricky – programming tool. Luckily, ChatGPT is surprisingly good at creating these “RegEx” for you. In this course, freeCodeCamp instructor Ania Kubow will teach you how to build your very own RegEx-generating dashboard using the OpenAI API and Retool.

4. When I first learned Git, I struggled a bit with the concepts of local repository, remote repository, and how to sync code changes between the two. But you don't have to struggle. Deborah Kurata has created this detailed Git tutorial that walks you through Git's key syncing features. She also included lots of short video demonstrations. If you're new to Git, this is a good place to start. (30 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-and-sync-git-and-github-repositories/

5. freeCodeCamp just rolled out a major update to our Android app. You can now complete coding challenges right on your phone, with our smooth mobile coding user experience. And yes – we are working on an iOS version of the mobile app for iPhone, too. (5 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-mobile-app-curriculum-update/

Quote of the Week: “A lot of developers don’t realize that the interviewer is there to help you. It’s their job to bring out the best in you. You should always be working with your interviewer to show them your skills, and make sure you’re going down the right path. When they ask you a coding question, here’s what you should do: clarify the problem with them, articulate your plan, and then talk them through your code as you’re writing it.” — Alex Chiou, Software Engineer and founder of Taro
