1. freeCodeCamp just published a full-length book on RegEx. Regular Expressions are one of the most powerful – and most confusing – features of programming languages. You'll learn concepts like flags, metacharacters, grouping, lookaround, and other advanced techniques. If you know even a little JavaScript, this book is for you. (full-length book): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/regular-expressions-for-javascript-developers/

2. We also published an API development handbook. This book will walk you through setting up your own backend architecture using the powerful FastAPI Python framework. You'll learn how to structure your API, add a database, test it, and deploy it. Along the way, you'll code your own IMDB-like review aggregator site. Be sure to bookmark this and share it with your developer friends. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/fastapi-quickstart/

3. And if you want to go even deeper into full-stack web development, this next course is for you. You'll code your own Next.js front end, API backend, and secure JSON Web Token user authentication system. You'll also learn about Middleware Route Protection, Appwrite, and MongoDB databases. (6 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/full-stack-with-nextjs-and-appwrite-course/

4. I'm going to attempt to explain 3 types of cloud storage in this single paragraph. Block Storage is like a book shelf that can hold a set number of pages – say 100. A 200 page book would take up 2 shelves. File Storage then adds abstractions on top of that, such as directories and hierarchy. Finally, Object Storage is the newest, most durable approach. It just uses flat files. And I'm just scratching the surface here. You should totally read more in Daniel's thoughtful tutorial. (15 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cloud-storage-options/

5. Learn to build “markerless” Augmented Reality objects that effortlessly float in space without the need for QR codes or other markers. This freeCodeCamp course will show you how to render a solar system around you. You'll render jet turbine simulations, virtual gardens, and even figure out how much furniture you can fit in your room. This is some cool emerging tech and I think you'll enjoy playing with it. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/take-your-first-steps-into-the-world-of-augmented-reality/

Finally, I've now recorded dozens of in-person interviews with developers for the new season of The freeCodeCamp Podcast – 5 of which are now live. Subscribe in whichever podcast player you like, and tune in each week for more insights: https://freecodecamp.libsyn.com/site/

1. TypeScript is a popular version of JavaScript that uses static types. This means that for each variable in your code, you specify whether it's a string, array, integer, or other data type. Why bother with this? Because it will dramatically reduce the number of bugs in your codebase. freeCodeCamp moved to TypeScript a few years ago, and we haven't looked back. If you know some basic JavaScript, you can quickly learn TypeScript and start reaping the benefits. This full-length handbook will teach you how to use React with TypeScript. You can code along at home and build your own type-safe To Do List app. (full-length handbook – 2 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/typescript-tutorial-for-react-developers/

2. We also published a full-length book on Astro. It's a popular new User Interface framework that a lot of my friends are adopting. Astro is written in TypeScript, and built for speed. This book is structured as a series of projects. You can code along at home and build your own Component Island, then build React apps on top of it. Along the way, you'll get a feel for Server-Side Rendering. (full-length book - 8 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-astro-ui-framework/

3. Steganography is the art of hiding things in plain sight. It translates to “the study of hidden things” in Greek. You can hide data inside of other data. Then – if you did it right – people will be none the wiser. This tutorial will show you how to use Steganography to hide information in text, images, video, and even network traffic itself. (15 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-steganography-hide-data-inside-data/

4. Deploying an app to the cloud can be a daunting task. Thankfully, we have Infrastructure-as-Code tools that make this process a lot simpler. This DevOps course will teach you how to use Terraform to configure your servers and domains. If you learn how to automate app deployment, you'll save a lot of time and headache down the line. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-terraform-to-deploy-a-site-on-google-cloud-platform

5. Postman is a powerful tool for testing your APIs, and making sure that new feature code doesn't break your existing codebase. This in-depth course will show you how to use Postman to debug your API endpoints, and ultimately automate deployment using Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery tools. You can code along at home, and do some CI/CD while listening to some AC/DC. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/master-api-testing-with-postman/

Finally, I'm excited to share that after a 4 year break, I've relaunched the freeCodeCamp Podcast. I spent several weeks in San Francisco interviewing developers in-person at public libraries across the city. And this week I'm heading to New York City to interview even more devs. I'll publish a new interview each week. The first 3 interviews are already live. (3 new 2-hour episodes + 85 older episodes): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-podcast-season-2-developer-interviews/

Quote of the Week: “I try to make a game that has beautiful open spaces, gaps, room for players to enjoy it in ways that were not authored. I never want it to be where you have to follow the rules completely, where you have to do things exactly as the designers intended.” — Hidetaka Miyazaki, developer, game designer, and creator of Dark Souls and Elden Ring
