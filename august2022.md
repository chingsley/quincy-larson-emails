4. When people say they're trying to get into tech, they often mean they're studying to become a software developer. This said, there are many other careers you can pursue in tech, which require varying degrees of coding skills. In this career guide, Sophia will share 19 different paths into tech – from Mobile App Development to User Experience Design – and some courses you could use to get started in any of them.

5. Have you ever seen a number followed by an exclamation point? In math, this is called a factorial. 5! is the number 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. In programming, if an algorithm has n! time complexity, it means it will be extremely slow and inefficient. Thankfully, you can almost always avoid this through more thoughtful programming. This quick tutorial will teach you a bit more about factorials, with some beginner JavaScript exercises for how you can calculate them.
