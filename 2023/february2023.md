1. It's 2023 and not only can you play other people's video games – you can build games yourself. This freeCodeCamp GameDev course will teach you how to use JavaScript to code your own physics-based action game. You'll learn how to animate game sprites, implement collision detection, and program enemy AI. Along the way, you'll learn some CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, HTML Canvas, and other broadly useful open source tools.

2. What's the simplest way to get started with Python web development? Well, many developers will recommend Flask. You can learn the basics of this light-weight web development framework in just a few hours of study. This Python Web Development course will teach you how to build and deploy a production-ready, database-driven Flask app. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/develop-database-driven-web-apps-with-python-flask-and-mysql/

3. z-index is easily one of the most confusing properties in all of CSS. It controls how HTML elements appear on the page, and how close they are to your user's eyeballs. This beginner tutorial will teach you about "Stacking Context." It will give you a solid mental model. Soon you too will understand how your browser's DOM renders elements on top of one another.

4. What are URIs? What are HTTP Headers? How does DNS work? This HTTP Networking Handbook will teach you many of the fundamentals about how the web works, with lots of helpful illustrations. You can bookmark it to use it as a reference. And freeCodeCamp also published a 4-hour video course to accompany it if you want to go even deeper.

5. Learn Asynchronous Programming for beginners. This in-depth guide will teach you key async JavaScript concepts. You'll learn about the Call Stack, the Callback Queue, Promises, Threading, Async-Await, and more. If you want to take your computer science knowledge to the next level, this is well worth your time.

1. When I was first learning to code, I had trouble understanding exactly what an API is. But I came to understand that, in its simplest form, an API is like a website. But instead of sending HTML to a browser or mobile app, an API sends data. Usually JSON data. This in-depth freeCodeCamp course is taught by experienced developer and instructor Craig Dennis. It will teach you how to code your own REST API – complete with server-side code, client-side data fetching, and more. (3 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/apis-for-beginners/

2. Remember those silly BuzzFeed personality quizzes? Like: "What type of cheese are you?" This course will teach you how to code your own BuzzFeed-style website using 3 different approaches: a vanilla JavaScript app, a React + JSON API app, and finally a TypeScript + Node.js mini-backend. This course is taught by long-time developer and freeCodeCamp instructor Ania Kubów. If you code along at home, I think you'll learn a ton from this course, and have a lot of fun along the way.

3. If you want to automate random tasks from your day-to-day life, Python is an excellent tool for the job. This tutorial will teach you how to write simple Python scripts that compress photos, turn text into speech, proof-read your messages, and more. (12 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-automation-scripts/

4. In my years as a developer, I've found that people greatly underestimate how powerful spreadsheets are for doing data analysis. You don't need to be a statistician to squeeze out meaningful insights from your spreadsheet. One of the most helpful spreadsheet functions is LOOKUP, and its descendants VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and XLOOKUP. This in-depth tutorial will show you how to wield these powerful functions to slice and dice data just the way you need it. (14 minute read + video): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lookup-functions-in-excel-google-sheets/

5. Also, freeCodeCamp just published a massive Git & GitHub course in Spanish. (Over the years, we've published several Git courses in English, too.) If you have Spanish-speaking friends who want to learn software development, please tell them that we now have in-depth courses on a broad range of coding topics. These are all taught in Spanish by Estefania. She's an experienced teacher and software engineer. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-git-and-github-in-spanish-course-for-beginners

1.freeCodeCamp just published a fully-animated computer basics course. Even if you've been using computers for years, this course may be helpful for you. And it should definitely be helpful for any friends and family members who've never used a laptop or desktop before. This course covers computer hardware, how cloud computing works, security basics, and more. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/computer-basics-beginners

2. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. And this in-depth course will teach you how this massive network of computers really works. You'll learn about Domain Name Systems, URL paths, security, and more. If you're interested in networks and back end development, this course should be well worth your time. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/http-networking-protocol-course/

3. Django is a popular Python web development framework. If you want to build a sophisticated website, it may make sense to learn Django. Like Node.js, Django is used at scale – most notably powering Instagram's website and APIs. This course will teach you Django fundamentals. You'll code your own online marketplace while learning about core Django features. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-django-by-building-a-marketplace/

4. If you want to go old school and never even touch your mouse when you're coding, you can use the Vim code editor. Vim comes built-in with many operating systems. It uses a sophisticated series of keyboard shortcuts for quick code edits. It can take years to get really good at Vim. But I know many developers who swear up and down that this is worth the time investment. If you want to take the plunge, this Vim Beginner's Guide is a great starting point. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vim-beginners-guide/

5. I started freeCodeCamp back in 2014. Since then, a ton of people have asked for my advice on how to learn to code and ultimately get freelance clients and developer jobs. So last year, I wrote an entire book summarizing my many tips. Even though one of the Big 5 book publishers in New York was interested in a book deal, I decided to instead make this book freely available to everyone who wants to become a professional developer. I hope it's helpful for you and your friends who are getting into coding. (full-length book – roughly 6 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/

More than a million people use freeCodeCamp every day. But it costs a lot to run this charity and our website. Did you know that we use more than 100 servers? And that we have more than a dozen translators working to make our learning resources available in languages like Spanish, Korean, Swahili, and Ukrainian? Please consider supporting our mission. You can help us make an even bigger impact: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate
