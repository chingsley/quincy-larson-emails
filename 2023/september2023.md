1. freeCodeCamp just published a beginner AI course where you can code your own assistant. You'll learn about vector embeddings and how you can use them on top of GPT-4 and other Large Language Models. This way you can code your own AI assistant with output customized by you. For example, you can throw all 11,000 tutorials freeCodeCamp has published into a database, embed them, and then your AI assistant can retrieve relevant tutorials when you ask it a question. This may sound pretty advanced, but modern tools make this a lot easier. You'll learn how to use OpenAI's GPT-4 API, LangChain, data from Hugging Face, and age-old Natural Language Processing techniques. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vector-embeddings-course/

2. Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complicated problems by breaking them down into smaller bits. You then store the solutions to these sub-problems in a table, where they can be more efficiently accessed, so the computer doesn't need to recalculate them each time. This efficient DP approach comes up all the time in Algorithms & Data Structure coding interview questions. And this freeCodeCamp course will teach you how to ace those questions. We teach DP using Java. But if you know Python, C++, or JavaScript, you may be able to follow along as well. (3 hour YouTube Course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-dynamic-programming-in-java/

3. Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure-as-Code DevOps tool. You can write Terraform code that provisions infrastructure from multiple cloud service providers at the same time. For example Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. freeCodeCamp uses Terraform extensively to wrangle our 100+ servers around the world. Now you can learn to leverage this power, too. And earn a professional certification while you're at it. This Terraform Certified Associate guide will help you grok the advanced concepts, modules, and workflows necessary to pass the exam. It also includes a full-length Terraform course freeCodeCamp published a few weeks ago. (45 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terraform-certified-associate-003-study-notes/

4. CSS transitions are a high-performance way to animate a webpage directly – using its HTML elements. And this handbook will teach you how to harness their power. You'll learn about animation keyframes, timing, looping, and more. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-transition-vs-css-animation-handbook/

5. Finally, freeCodeCamp published a Fundamentals of Finance and Economics course. It covers a lot of key concepts you learn in business school, such as Time-Value of Money, Capital Budgeting, Financial Statements, and how Macroeconomic Forces shape industries. We plan to publish a lot more courses like this one in the future, to complement our already massive selection of math and computer science courses.

1. The first time I used ChatGPT, I was impressed. But I didn't yet realize how useful it would become in my day-to-day work as a developer. Only after I learned some Prompt Engineering techniques did I get good at communicating with the AI. Now I'm much more effective at getting Large Language Models to do tasks for me. That's why I'm excited to share this new freeCodeCamp course on Prompt Engineering. Ania Kubów will teach you techniques like Few-Shot Prompting, Vectors, Embeddings, and how to reduce AI hallucinations.
