Quote of the Week: “I currently use Ubuntu Linux, on a standalone laptop. It has no internet connection. I occasionally carry flash memory drives between this machine and the Macs that I use for network surfing and graphics. But I trust my family jewels only to Linux.” — Donald Knuth, Stanford professor and 1974 Turing Award recipient (the "Nobel Prize of computer science")

3. When you visit a website like freeCodeCamp.org, your computer starts sending packets of data back and forth across the internet using the Internet Protocol. The IPv4 protocol came out way back in 1980, and gives every server its own 4-byte address. (That's 4 numbers between 0 and 255. For example, the localhost address: 127.0.0.1). But this only results in 4.3 billion possible combinations. And websites are already using almost all of these. Thankfully, the newer IPv6 protocol can save humanity from the threat of "address exhaustion". This article will show you how IPv6 works. (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ipv4-vs-ipv6-what-is-the-difference-between-ip-addressing-schemes/

7 years ago today, I deployed the first version of the freeCodeCamp.org website from my closet office. (Apartments in San Francisco are small, and that was the only quiet space I had to work in.) I wasn't sure if anyone else would find the website to be helpful. But a few people hung around on the forum and started contributing to the open source codebase. Today, the community helps more than half a million visitors each day. This is all possible thanks to the thousands of people who have contributed their talents or made donations to our nonprofit. And we are just getting started. There is so much work still to be done. So many math and programming concepts we want to teach the world. If you want to get involved, the easiest way you can help is to donate to support our nonprofit's mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-donate-to-free-code-camp/

Quote of the Week: “I refer to layers 1 through 4 of the OSI Model all the time. They’re a simplified and fairly easy way to understand the obtuse and arcane way modern networks are kludged together. It’s really hard to convey the layers necessary to do proper monitoring and detection without that understanding.” — Lesley Carhart, Security Researcher and Digital Forensics Expert
