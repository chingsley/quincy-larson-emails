1. freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive Computer Vision course. In this course, you'll use Python and the powerful TensorFlow library to diagnose Malaria, generate original images, and even predict human emotions from facial expressions. You'll learn about Vision Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, and a ton of other cutting edge computer science concepts. The only prerequisite for this course is some beginner Python programming skills, which you can also learn from one of freeCodeCamp's many open courses. Don't let yourself be daunted by all of this. You can do it. (37 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-computer-vision-with-deep-learning-and-tensorflow/

2. Rust is still one of the newer programming languages, but many codebases are already adopting it. Even the Linux Kernel now uses Rust. And Stack Overflow users have voted it the “most loved” programming language 7 years in a row. You can learn how to harness the raw performance power of Rust through this new freeCodeCamp Rust course. You'll learn about variables, functions, control flow, modules, and even closures. Enjoy.

3. Learn the key Design Patterns that power massive distributed systems. This new book by an experienced back-end developer will teach you the fundamental challenges of distributing work across many data centers around the world. In this intermediate software engineering book, you'll learn more than a dozen Design Patterns including the Saga Pattern, the Split Brain Pattern, and my personal favorite, the Sidecar Pattern. Who doesn't love sidecars? (full book - 2 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/design-patterns-for-distributed-systems/

4. This new book from the freeCodeCamp community will guide you through three popular JavaScript front-end development tools: Angular, Vue.js, and React. Each of these tools can be used to accomplish similar goals, but you only need one of them. So which one should you use for a given project? This book will help you decide. It will walk you through code examples for each of these tools, so you can understand their relative strengths and weaknesses.

5. When you're doing front-end development, there are so many ways you can style your React components. You could use CSS preprocessors, component libraries, or just plain-vanilla CSS. This quick tutorial will give you some code examples of the most common approaches, and share the pros and cons of each. (12 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-style-a-react-app/

I hope you're enjoying these new books and courses as much as I am. All of us at freeCodeCamp are working hard to create open learning resources that teach all of these new tools. We want to put this knowledge and this power into the hands of everyone, regardless of their financial situation.
