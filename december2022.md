1. This freeCodeCamp course will teach you how to code your own Python apps that run directly on Windows, Mac, or Linux – not just in a browser. You'll learn powerful Python libraries like Qt and PySide6. This way you can build apps that run natively on computers, and leverage their full processing power. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-gui-development-using-pyside6-and-qt/

2. Swift is a powerful programming language developed by Apple. A lot of developers who build apps for either iOS and MacOS prefer to code in Swift. In this in-depth course, a lead iOS developer will teach you Swift development fundamentals. You'll learn about variables, operators, error handling, and even asynchronous programming.

3. If you're preparing for a coding interview as part of your developer job search, you're going to want to read this. Dijkstra's Algorithm is an iconic graph algorithm with many uses in computer science. You can use it to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, or the shortest path from one fixed node to the rest of the nodes in a graph. This detailed explanation – with diagrams and a pseudocode example – will help you appreciate its true brilliance.

4. If you want to move beyond the basics with React, this intermediate JavaScript tutorial will teach you about Separation of Concerns. You'll learn about React Container Components, Presentational Components, and how to make your code easier to maintain over time.

5. 2022 was a massive year for the global freeCodeCamp community. Thousands of people volunteered to help make our charity and our learning resources better. I'm thrilled to announce this year's Top Contributors. These 696 friendly people have earned this distinction through going above and beyond in helping fellow learners. Whether they answered questions on the community forum, translated tutorials, contributed to our open source codebases, or designed new courses – we deeply appreciate their efforts.

Even if you haven't had time to get involved in the freeCodeCamp community as a volunteer, you can still join the 8,413 kind people who directly support our charity's mission each month. If you have the means, we will put your donations to good use creating even more learning resources: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “A most important, but also most elusive, aspect of any tool is its influence on the habits of those who train themselves in its use. If the tool is a programming language, this influence is – whether we like it or not – an influence on our thinking habits.” — Edsger Dijkstra, Mathematician and Computer Scientist

1. freeCodeCamp just published a course that will teach you how to code your own API using Python. APIs are like websites designed for other computers to understand, rather than humans. Instead of sharing text, images, videos – and other media that humans understand – APIs just share raw data, such as JSON responses. This course will show you how to build your own REST API using the popular Python Django REST framework.

2. MATLAB is a popular programming language used by scientists, and in industries like aerospace. Over the years, we've had so many people request a MATLAB course on freeCodeCamp. And today I'm thrilled to share one with you. This course will teach you MATLAB programming fundamentals, including how to use its powerful Integrated Development Environment. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-matlab-with-this-crash-course/

3. React Testing Library is a powerful front end testing tool for your apps. And this in-depth tutorial will walk you through how to use it. You'll learn unit testing fundamentals, as well as JavaScript testing tools like Jest. And you'll get to try out Vite, a new tool for bootstrapping your React apps.

4. Have you ever wondered why we write it “freeCodeCamp” with a lowercase f? That's because we thought it would be funny to use Camel Case like JavaScript does for its variables. And this is just one style of cases that developers use. This guide will introduce you to other popular styles of writing variable names, including Snake Case, Pascal Case, and even Kebab Case.

5. 2022 has been a colossal year for the freeCodeCamp community. People spent more than 4 billion minutes learning on freeCodeCamp this year. I wrote this article about some of the areas we've been focused on expanding. Not just the university degree program, but also our massive translation efforts. You can check out some of the numbers for yourself. (5 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-2022-usage-statistics/

It's such an honor to share these learning resources with you each week. These letters are only a glimpse into the contributions of thousands of open source contributors who are helping expand our charity's learning platform. I encourage you to join me and 8,384 other people who donate to freeCodeCamp each month. Support our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate
