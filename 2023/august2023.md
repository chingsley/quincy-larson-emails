1. The freeCodeCamp community loves JavaScript almost as much as we love Python. And we published several JavaScript tutorials for you this week. First and foremost, this tutorial by Kolade Chris will teach you some advanced JS concepts like Template Interpolation, Unary Plus, the Spread Operator, Destructuring, and Math Object methods. With tons of code examples, this tutorial should help you take your JS to the next level. (40 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-tips-for-better-web-dev-projects/

2. Next you'll want to brush up on your JavaScript Operators. These are the valves that control how data flows through your app. This tutorial by freeCodeCamp contributor Nathan Sebhastian will walk you through Logical Operators, Comparison Operators, and even Bitwise Operators for extremely granular control. You'll even learn the ultra-concise Ternary Operator. (25 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-operators/

3. And if you want to turn your JS skills all the way up to 11, you can learn JavaScript Promises. Unlike Python, JavaScript is famously an asynchronous programming language. If you're a beginner, this asynchronicity can really melt your brain. That's where Promises come in. They help you rein in your parallel-running code so you can harness its true high-performance power.

4.freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive website optimization course, taught by prolific teacher Beau Carnes. You'll learn about caching techniques, server configuration, monitoring, Domain Name Systems, Content Delivery Networks, and more. This course is focused on WordPress, but you can apply most of these concepts to your website regardless of which tools you're using. Beau also included a book-length optimization guide. You should be able to read it and find a few low-hanging fruit ways to speed up your site.

5. Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure-as-Code DevOps tool. You can write Terraform code that provisions infrastructure from multiple cloud service providers at the same time. For example Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. freeCodeCamp uses Terraform extensively to wrangle our 100+ servers around the world. And now you can learn to use it, too, and earn a professional certification as well. This Terraform cert prep course will help you grok the advanced concepts, modules, and workflows necessary to pass the exam.

Finally, I created a video of my own. Over the years, one of the most common questions people ask me is: "With freeCodeCamp and other self-teaching tools, do I still need to go to university?" I answer this question and many more about technology, higher education, and the labor market. If you're considering going to university or have college-age kids, I encourage you to watch this and share it with your friends. I'd welcome any feedback you have.

Quote of the Week: “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.” — Atwood's Law, coined by Stack Overflow co-founder Jeff Atwood. I interviewed Jeff Atwood at his home in California. And I'm publishing my interview this week on The freeCodeCamp Podcast. Search for it in your podcast player of choice. And tell your friends.

1. freeCodeCamp has partnered with Harvard to bring you another mind-expanding CS50 course: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. You'll get broad exposure to Machine Learning theory: Optimization, Classification, Graph Search Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, and more. You can code along at home and implement your own basic AIs using Python. This is a full university course that's completely self-paced and freely available. Enjoy. (12 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/harvard-cs50s-ai-python-course

2. freeCodeCamp also published an end-to-end testing course. You'll learn QA Engineering with the powerful Cypress JavaScript library. Some of the concepts you'll pick up include Assertions, Command Chaining, Intercepts, and Multi-Page Testing. Every developer should be able to double as their own QA engineer, and to write their own tests. This course will show you how.

3. Like any good board game, JavaScript is easy to learn and hard to master. And in this advanced JS course, freeCodeCamp instructor Tapas Adhikary will teach you a wide range of function concepts. You'll learn about the Call Stack, Nested Functions, Callback Functions, Higher-Order Functions, Closures, and everyone's favorite: Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions – also known as IIFE's (pronounced "iffy"). Put on your learning cap. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mastering-javascript-functions-for-beginners/

4. Learn JavaScript by reverse-engineering your own JS utility library – like the ever-popular Lodash library. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to hand-implement more than a dozen array methods, object methods, and math methods. This is excellent practice for brushing up on your JavaScript knowledge. And a lot of the code you write may make it into your other codebases. (45 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-javascript-utility-library-like-lodash/

5. When it comes to deploying your apps to production, there are a ton of options – many of which don't cost a thing. freeCodeCamp contributor Ijeoma Igboagu compares several hosting platforms including Vercel and Netlify, and shares the strengths and weaknesses of each. She also shows you how to deploy to these services using Git. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-websites-and-applications/

It's been an amazing week for learners everywhere. And the freeCodeCamp community is just getting started. I have so many more in-depth courses planned for the final 143 days of 2023.
