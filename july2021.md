Quote of the Week: “History has taught us: never underestimate the amount of money, time, and effort someone will expend to thwart a security system. It's always better to assume the worst. Assume your adversaries are better than they are. Assume science and technology will soon be able to do things they cannot yet. Give yourself a margin for error. Give yourself more security than you need today. When the unexpected happens, you'll be glad you did.” – Bruce Schneier, Security Researcher

Quote of the Week: “In many ways, Python is a dull language. It borrows solid old concepts from many other languages: boring syntax, unsurprising semantics, few automatic coercions. But that's one of the things I like about Python.” - Tim Peters, Author of "Zen of Python" and creator of the Timsort sorting algorithm
