1. Is that a hot dog or not a hot dog? This Python AI course will teach you how to build a Convolutional Neural Network that can classify images. You'll use a database of food photos to train your AI to spot the hot dogs. You can also use CNNs for natural language processing – think ChatGPT – and time series forecasting. This is an excellent beginner AI course taught by freeCodeCamp instructor and Google engineer Kylie Ying.

2. Learn to create your own programming language. If you know some basic Python, you're all set to dive in. This freeCodeCamp course will teach you language design concepts and data structures. You'll learn about Object Oriented Programming, Binary Trees, Linear Programming, Tokenization, Lexing, Parsing, and more.

3. freeCodeCamp just published this full-length handbook on JavaScript. It will teach you how to set up your computer for JavaScript development with tools like VS Code. Then it will walk you through many features of the programming language, including Variables, Data Types, Operators, and Control Flow. You can read this and bookmark it for future reference as you continue to expand your JS skills. (full handbook – 3 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-for-beginners/

4. Most developers learn how to use Git's merge feature to add new code to an existing codebase. Git Merge preserves the exact history of code contributions. But sometimes you need a more surgical tool. That's where Git Rebase comes in. This handbook by software engineer and CTO Omer Rosenbaum will teach you how to use Git Merge, Git Rebase, Cherry Picking, and more. (full handbook – 3 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-rebase-handbook/

5. What's the difference between Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning? This quick article will explain these two approaches to Machine Learning, and how each works. You'll also learn some AI techniques that each approach applies. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning/

So many amazing books and courses this week. A huge thank you to the freeCodeCamp community and these thoughtful contributors. And a big thanks to all of you who support our charity. If you're not donating yet, please consider joining our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Joke of the Week: “It's only called a Neural Network if it comes from the Neuralè region of France. Otherwise you have to call it a logistic regression.” — Vicki Boykis, Machine Learning Engineer

1. In this beginner course, you'll learn how to code your own 3D role-playing game. You'll use the open source Godot Game Engine to learn character creation, animation trees, inventory systems, and monster AI. This course includes all the 3D models and game environment assets you'll need to build the game. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-3d-rpg-game-with-godot/

2. And freeCodeCamp also published this advanced C# course. If you're already somewhat experienced with programming, and want to go deep on C#, this is the course for you. You'll learn about C# Delegates, Events, Generics, Asynchronous Programming, and Reflection. You'll also learn advanced LINQ and .NET concepts. (15 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-advanced-c-concepts/

3. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are yet another tool developers can use to get things done. But one big limitation is that LLMs are pre-trained, and lack access to current information. That's where the new GPT Plugin ecosystem comes in. This tutorial will show you how plugins work so you can build one and fetch real-time data using APIs. (15 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-chatgpt-plugin-case-study/

4. And if you're interested in LLMs, I encourage you to learn how to use LangChain. It's an open source Python library that breaks documents down into chunks and makes them easier for LLMs to search, analyze, and summarize. This tutorial will walk you through using LangChain and other libraries to create a Twitter bot that can generate text and reference up-to-date information, such as Wikipedia articles. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-an-ai-tweet-generator-openai-langchain/

5. Even if you don't have a computer science degree, you can still learn computer science. This article will give you a broad overview of the field, and share some books and courses you may find helpful. They cover algorithms, architecture, operating systems, databases, networks, and more.

Quote of the Week: “I try to make a game that has beautiful open spaces, gaps, room for players to enjoy it in ways that were not authored. I never want it to be where you have to follow the rules completely, where you have to do things exactly as the designers intended.” — Hidetaka Miyazaki, developer, game designer, and creator of Dark Souls and Elden Ring
