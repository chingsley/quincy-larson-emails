1. The freeCodeCamp community is proud to bring you this latest computer science course in our partnership with Harvard. You'll learn Web Development with Python and the popular Django framework. You'll start by learning some HTML, CSS, and Git. Then you'll learn about user interface design, testing, scalability, and security. I hope you are able to code along at home, expand your skills, and enjoy some top-notch teaching. (14 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-web-development-from-harvard-university-cs50/

2. One of our most requested courses over the past few years: LaTeX – the powerful typesetting system used to design academic papers, scientific publications, and books. You'll learn these tools and concepts from Michelle Krummel. She has more than 20 years of teaching experience. You'll learn about mathematical notation, TexMaker, Overleaf, and the many packages available in the LaTeX ecosystem.

3. One of the most critical concepts you should understand about Git is Branching. We've got you covered. In this tutorial, Deborah Kurata will teach you how to create a local Git repository with a main branch, then branch off of it. She'll show you how to commit your code changes, then merge those files back into the main branch. This is what I like to call the "core gameplay loop" of software development. Enjoy.

4. You may have heard about REST APIs. But have you heard about its predecessor, SOAP? Or cutting edge GraphQL APIs? This tutorial by software engineer Germán Cocca will teach you about the Client-Server Model, and how each of these API paradigms work. At the end of the day, an API is just "a set of defined rules that establishes how one application can communicate with another." By the end, you'll have a better appreciation for how all these computers around the world communicate with one another. (30 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-vs-graphql-apis/

5. If you're a Linux enthusiast like I am, you may appreciate the sheer power Linux gives you. But only if you're willing to take the time to learn how to wield that power. The find command is one of those powerful tools. This tutorial will show you how to search through file systems by owner, type, permissions, recency, and even regex search. This is some SysAdmin-level stuff. And we'll keep these Linux tutorials coming. (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-search-files-effectively-in-linux/

1. You may have heard about AIs that can beat the world's best Chess players, Go players, and even Starcraft players. Many of these AIs use a game-playing algorithm called AlphaZero. The AI starts out by playing a game against itself to learn the rules and discover strategies. After a few hours of training, it's often able to play the game at a superhuman level. This Python course will teach you how to code your own AlphaZero algorithm from scratch that can win at both Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4. You'll learn about Monte Carlo Tree Search, Neural Networks, and more. This is an ideal course for anyone who wants to learn more about Machine Learning.

2. Security Researcher and freeCodeCamp contributor Sonya Moisset just made her Open Source Security Handbook freely available. If you're planning to open-source some of your code, this should be a helpful read. You'll learn about Static Analysis, Supply Chain Attacks, Secret Sprawl, and other s words. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/oss-security-best-practices/

3. Excel is a surprisingly powerful tool for doing data analysis. And you can get even more mileage out of Excel if you meld it with Python and the popular Pandas library. This tutorial will teach you how to merge spreadsheets, clean and filter them, and import them into datasets. You'll even learn how to turn spreadsheet data into Matplotlib data visualizations.

4. If you're just starting your developer journey, you may hear a lot about APIs and how to use them in your projects. Well, this tutorial will give you a ton of examples of public APIs you can play around with. Weather APIs, News APIs, even an API to help you identify different breeds of dogs. This is a good place to get started. (16 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/public-apis-for-developers/

5. My friends Jess and Ramón have taught thousands of people how to code using the freeCodeCamp curriculum. And this week they're launching a new cohort program called the Bad Website Club. The pressure is off. Your website doesn't have to look perfect. You can instead just relax and enjoy the process of building websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Everything is freely available. You can join us at the launch party live stream on March 6. (5 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-bad-website-club-and-more-free-bootcamps/

I've been sending these emails every Friday for 7 years now. It's such a joy to prepare these for you. A huge thanks to all the developers and teachers who help freeCodeCamp create these open learning resources. Now you can help our charity accomplish even more.

Quote of the Week: “AlphaGo's way is not to make territory here or there, but to place every stone in a position where it will be most useful. This is the true theory of Go: not ‘what do I want to build?’, but rather ‘how can I use every stone to its full potential?’” — Professional Go player Fan Hui after losing 5 games to AlphaGo, an AlphaZero algorithm trained to play the ancient strategy game of Go
