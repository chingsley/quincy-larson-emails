Quote of the Week: “An individual block of code takes moments to write, minutes to debug, and can last forever without being touched again. It’s only when you visit code written yesterday that having code written in a clear, consistent style becomes extremely useful. Understandable code frees up your mental bandwidth from having to puzzle out inconsistencies, making it easier to maintain and enhance projects of all sizes.” — Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Python Django developer and author
