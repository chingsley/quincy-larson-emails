Finally, I created a video of my own. Over the years, one of the most common questions people ask me is: "With freeCodeCamp and other self-teaching tools, do I still need to go to university?" I answer this question and many more about technology, higher education, and the labor market. If you're considering going to university or have college-age kids, I encourage you to watch this and share it with your friends. I'd welcome any feedback you have.
