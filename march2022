Quote of the Week: “I'm old-fashioned. I like my CSS seperated from my HTML; my HTML seperated from my JS; my JS separated from my CSS. I like my JS layer only added when I need it, usually progressively. CSS added progressively on top of semantic markup. I don't fight the C in CSS, I embrace it.” — Sara Soueidan, Software Engineer and Accessibility Advocate
