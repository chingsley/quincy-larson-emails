2. Learn to automate tasks and get Linux servers to do your bidding. This Bash course will teach you powerful command line skills you can use on Mac, Linux, and even Windows (using Subsystem for Linux). You'll learn about input redirection, logic operators, control flow, exit codes, and even text manipulation with AWK and SED.

(2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/firebase-course-html-css-javascript/

4. Linting is not just when you clean out your pockets. It's also a term for tools that can spot errors in your source code before you even run it. This tutorial will walk you through the history of linting tools stretching all the way back to the 1970s. It will also teach you about Code Formatters like Prettier, Beautify, and ESLint. This is an excellent primer for JavaScript devs. (15 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/using-prettier-and-jslint/

5. Keeping up with all this year's AI breakthroughs can feel overwhelming. Which is why I'm thrilled to share Edem Gold's History of AI, which stretches all the way back to the 1950s. You'll learn about Perceptrons, Hidden Markov Models, Deep learning, and more. (25 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-history-of-ai/

Wow. Another week, another wave of AI breakthroughs. The freeCodeCamp community is developing several courses to teach you both beginner and advanced AI concepts, and all the math you'll need to build your own AI systems. As you may know, we're a tax-exempt public charity. It costs a lot to run our 106 servers in data centers around the world. If you'd like to support our work, it will be a big help to our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “Early AI was mainly based on logic. You're trying to make computers that reason like people. The second route is from biology: You're trying to make computers that can perceive and act and adapt like animals.” — Geoffrey Hinton, Computer Scientist, Cognitive Psychologist, and the “Godfather of Artificial Intelligence”, talking about the increasingly successful neural network approach to Machine Learning

1. freeCodeCamp just published a new Front End Development course. You can code along at home and build your own game in raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then you'll learn how to refactor your game to make use of the Model-View-Controller design pattern. You'll then add TypeScript to improve the reliability of your code, and React to make your game more dynamic. This is an excellent project-oriented course for beginners. (10 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/frontend-web-development-in-depth-project-tutorial/

2. And if you want even more web development practice, here's another beginner's course. It will teach you how to build a personal website using a lot of contemporary tools, including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Sanity. Kapehe has taught a lot of courses with freeCodeCamp, and I think you'll dig her friendly teaching style.

3. You may have heard the terms “Symmetric Encryption” and “Asymmetric Encryption”. But what do they mean? This primer will teach you about these concepts, and how they power both the SSL protocol and its successor, TLS. Encryption makes the World Wide Web go ‘round. (15 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/encryption-explained-in-plain-english/

4. And on the topic of encryption, it turns out that even something as basic as storing something safely on your computer requires quite a bit of applied mathematics. This tutorial on “encryption at rest” will walk you through some of the cryptography techniques developers use – including hashing and salting. Just thinking about those makes me hungry for some hash browns. (8 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/encryption-at-rest/

5. My friend Dhawal created this comprehensive list of 850 university courses that are freely available, which you can convert into college credit. There are a ton of different subjects to choose from, including Computer Science, Data Science, Math, and Information Security.

A quick note on GPT-4 and other Large Language Model (LLM) tools: I'm spending several hours each week practicing with these tools, and learning how to use them more effectively.

I still do all my writing the old fashion way. But I'm finding LLMs to be helpful in a lot of other ways, including simplifying my code.

Over the years, freeCodeCamp has published several courses on Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Linear Algebra, and other key concepts that power these new AI tools. And we're hard at work developing many more. We'll release these throughout the coming months, so stay tuned.

With all the courses freeCodeCamp publishes each week, you might be surprised to learn that we're just a tiny charity with a tiny staff of teachers. Thankfully, we have thousands of volunteers around the world. And we have thousands of people who donate each month to help us pay for servers. I encourage you to join these kind people and start supporting our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

1. The most dreaded part of the developer job search is the “coding interview”. This is where a software engineer asks you to solve programming challenges right there on the spot – often by writing code on a whiteboard.

Well, freeCodeCamp has hundreds of hours of practice challenges to help prepare you for this. And even better – we just published a course taught by my friends Kylie and Keith, who are both experienced software engineers.

This “Mock Interview” will give you a much better idea of what a typical coding interview process is like. Kylie takes on the role of coding interview candidate, and answers Keith's questions about Object-Oriented Programming, Dynamic Programming, and more. (75-minute hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/real-world-coding-interview-for-software-engineering/

2. Learn how to build a 3D animation that runs right inside a browser. You'll use React, WebGi, Three.js, and GSAP. You'll learn how to display 3D models on a website, animate them, and even optimize those 3D animations for mobile devices. Even though this may sound advanced, we made this course as beginner-accessible as possible. By the end of the course, you'll deploy your own 3D-animated website to the web. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/3d-react-webgi-threejs-course/

3. Regular Expressions are a powerful – but notoriously tricky – programming tool. Luckily, ChatGPT is surprisingly good at creating these “RegEx” for you. In this course, freeCodeCamp instructor Ania Kubow will teach you how to build your very own RegEx-generating dashboard using the OpenAI API and Retool. (30-minute YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-chatgpt-to-build-a-regex-generator/

4. When I first learned Git, I struggled a bit with the concepts of local repository, remote repository, and how to sync code changes between the two. But you don't have to struggle. Deborah Kurata has created this detailed Git tutorial that walks you through Git's key syncing features. She also included lots of short video demonstrations. If you're new to Git, this is a good place to start. (30 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-and-sync-git-and-github-repositories/

5. freeCodeCamp just rolled out a major update to our Android app. You can now complete coding challenges right on your phone, with our smooth mobile coding user experience. And yes – we are working on an iOS version of the mobile app for iPhone, too. (5 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-mobile-app-curriculum-update/

Quote of the Week: “A lot of developers don’t realize that the interviewer is there to help you. It’s their job to bring out the best in you. You should always be working with your interviewer to show them your skills, and make sure you’re going down the right path. When they ask you a coding question, here’s what you should do: clarify the problem with them, articulate your plan, and then talk them through your code as you’re writing it.” — Alex Chiou, Software Engineer and founder of Taro
