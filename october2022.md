1. DevOps engineers help software run at massive scale. The field of DevOps combines programming – the Dev part – with system administration – the Ops part. It is a highly specialized – and high-paying – field to go into. This course for intermediate learners will teach you two of the most widely-used DevOps tools: Docker and Kubernetes. You'll learn about Containers, Microservices, Persistence, Observability, and more. With these in your toolbox, you'll be able to efficiently scale your apps, websites, and APIs to millions of users.

2. Do you remember those old clickety-clackety arrival-departure schedule boards? The kind you might see in a train station or an airport? In this JavaScript course for beginners, you'll code one of those. And you'll code that same flight widget in three ways: with plain-vanilla JS, with a REST API, and with a database. Along the way, freeCodeCamp teacher Ania Kubów will teach you a ton about full-stack development.

3. Big O Notation is a tool that developers use to understand how much time a piece of code will take to execute. Computer Scientists call this "Time Complexity." This comes up all the time in day-to-day programming, and in job interviews. As a developer, you will definitely want to understand Big O Notation well. And that's precisely why freeCodeCamp engineer Joel Olawanle wrote this Big O cheat sheet for you, complete with code examples. You can bookmark it, then refer to it when you need to calculate the Time Complexity of your code. (18 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-cheat-sheet-time-complexity-chart/

4. Learn the Angular JavaScript framework by coding your own ecommerce web shop. This beginner course – taught by frequent freeCodeCamp contributor Slobodan Gajic – will teach you Angular fundamentals. You'll set up your development environment, build a homepage, code the shopping cart logic, and even implement Stripe checkout.

5. An IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. I must admit, I had to look up that acronym. This in-depth tutorial by prolific freeCodeCamp contributor Oluwatobi Sofela will walk you through JavaScript Functions, Parameters, Code Blocks, and IIFEs too. An excellent resource for the beginner JS developer. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-function-iife-parameters-code-blocks-explained/

Quote of the Week: “I hooked a neural network up to my Roomba. I wanted it to learn to navigate without bumping into things, so I set up a reward scheme to encourage speed and discourage hitting the bumper sensors. It learnt to drive backwards, because there are no bumpers on the back.” — Custard Smingleigh, Developer and Roboticist
