In short, people have used freeCodeCamp for more than 2 billion minutes in 2021 – the equivalent of 4,000 years. As you read this sentence, more than 4,000 people are on freeCodeCamp learning about programming and technology. And we've accomplished all of this on a tiny budget, thanks to a growing community of volunteers. This is my full annual report.

Quote of the Week: “In terms of removing the socioeconomic barriers to Computer Science education, I am a huge fan of Quincy Larson and freeCodeCamp.org. When I'm hiring an engineer, I really can't tell if they learned something at college for $150K, or a paid boot camp for $50K, or freeCodeCamp.org for free.” — Mekka Okereke, a Director of Engineering at Google

By the way, next week is the Thanksgiving Holiday in the US. So I'll send out my next email on December 3rd. Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family. In the meantime, if you need more learning resources, there's an archive of each of these emails I've sent over the past 5 years (all 267 of them): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/quincy-larson-5-links-worth-your-time-email-full-list/
