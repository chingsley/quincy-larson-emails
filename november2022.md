We will put anything you can give us to good use creating even more open courses for everyone around the world: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “Games were not just a diversion, I realized. Games could make you feel. If great literature could wield its power through nothing but black squiggles on a page, how much more could be done with movement, sound, and color?” — Sid Meier, Game Developer and creator of the Civilization strategy game series

5. If you are new to software development you are going to hear the word "solid" a lot. And not just to describe hard drives. SOLID is an acronym for a set of software engineering principles. These can help guide you in designing systems. In this quick primer, freeCodeCamp engineer Joel Olawanle will break down each of these concepts. This way, next time you're doing some Object-Oriented Programming, you'll already have a feel for how to best go about it.

As you may know, freeCodeCamp is a public charity. We've got the same tax-exempt status as The Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, the YMCA, and other big charities. Except that we operate on a fraction of the budget. More than a million people use freeCodeCamp each day, and yet this is only possible thanks to the 8,273 kind people who donate. Help us in our mission to create math, computer science, and programming resources for everyone. Get involved: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “The disorder of the desk, the floor, the yellow Post-it notes everywhere, the whiteboards covered with scrawl. All this is the outward manifestation of the messiness of human thought. The messiness cannot go into the program. It piles up around the programmer.” — Ellen Ullman, Programmer and Author

1. freeCodeCamp just published a hands-on Microservice Architecture course. This is a great way to learn about Distributed Systems. You can code along at home, and build your own video-to-MP3 file converter app. Along the way, you'll learn some MongoDB, Kubernetes, and MySQL. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/microservices-and-software-system-design-course/

2. TypeScript is like JavaScript, but with static types. For each variable, you specify whether it's a string, integer, boolean, or other data type. If you already know some JavaScript, TypeScript may not take that much time to learn. And it can reduce the number of bugs in your code. freeCodeCamp has converted almost our entire codebase to use TypeScript. It still has all the power of JavaScript, but it's now a bit easier for us to build new features. This beginner course will teach you everything you need to get started coding TypeScript. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programming-in-typescript/

3. Testing is a vital part of the software development process. You want to ensure that all your app's features work as intended. Thankfully, there are some powerful tools out there to help you write robust tests. This handbook will teach you how to code the most fundamental type of test: unit tests. It will also show you some web development best practices for using Jest and the React Testing Library. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-unit-tests-in-react-redux/

4. Learn CSS and Responsive Web Design for beginners. Jessica's new guide will walk you through one of freeCodeCamp's most popular projects: coding your own café menu.

(45 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css/

5. Also, freeCodeCamp just published a massive Bootstrap course in Spanish, where you'll code your own portfolio. (We've also published several Bootstrap courses in English, too). If you have Spanish-speaking friends who want to learn web development and design, please tell them that we now have in-depth courses on a broad range of coding topics. These are all taught in Spanish by Estefania. She's an experienced teacher and software engineer.

Quote of the Week:

“The Evolution of Software Architecture:
1990s: Spaghetti-Oriented Architecture (AKA Copy & Paste)
2000s: Lasagna-Oriented Architecture (AKA Layered Monolith)
2010s: Ravioli-Oriented Architecture (AKA Microservices)
What's next? Probably Pizza-Oriented Architecture.”
