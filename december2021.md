The freeCodeCamp community is working hard on several major initiatives to make it easier for ambitious people like you to learn to code:

1. The upcoming Math and Data Science curriculum expansion
2. A mobile app for learning on the go
3. And another fun project that I'll announce right before Christmas.

We're putting every donation we receive to good use building these learning resources. If 2021 has been a good year for you financially, I encourage you to support our nonprofit and our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-donate-to-free-code-camp/
