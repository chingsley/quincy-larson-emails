3. You may have heard the term DOM Manipulation when talking about web development. But what exactly is the Document Object Model? In this tutorial, Jessica will show you how the DOM works, and how even sophisticated single-page applications still rely on HTML elements as anchors to the page.

4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is how computers glean insights from human languages like English. Python has a powerful NLP library called spaCy. In this course, data scientist and professor Dr. Mattingly will introduce you to NLP concepts like Word Vectors, Named Entity Recognition, EntityRulers and more.

5. Before there was BitTorrent, people shared files the old fashioned way – from the command line. And if you have a Unix shell available (Mac, Linux, or the Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux should work) you can relive that 1980s experience. This tutorial will show you how to use the handy SCP command to move files from one computer to another using SSH.

1. Way back in 1983, telephone companies came together to create the Open System Interconnections Model. This OSI Model is a common way to think about networks and security – from the software application layer all the way down to the physical infrastructure. This tutorial will help you understand each of the network layers and the relationships between them. (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/osi-model-computer-networking-for-beginners/

2. If you have a friend or relative who is completely new to computers, share this course with them. It uses fun animations to explain how computers work, how the internet works, and some computer security basics. I watched it with my kindergarten-aged kids, and even they understood it. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/computer-basics-for-absolute-beginners/

3. Terraform is a popular Infrastructure-As-Code tool. I just did a search on Indeed (a job board website) and found more than 23,000 open job postings that mention Terraform. If you are interested in DevOps or cloud computing, this comprehensive course will prepare you to pass the Terraform Associate Certification.

4. TensorFlow is a powerful Python machine learning tool. freeCodeCamp already has tons of courses on TensorFlow, but this week we published a new one focused on using TensorFlow for Computer Vision. You'll learn how to build a neural network then train it to see various traffic signs and recognize their meaning. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-tensorflow-for-computer-vision/

5. How to learn programming – a 14-step roadmap for beginners. This software engineer reflects on 20 years of learning to code, and how he would do things differently if he were starting over again today. (1 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-programming/

These are just 5 of the learning resources that our community has published this week. Over the past 7 years, our nonprofit has published 600 full-length courses and 7,000 tutorials. We also maintain a fully-interactive full stack development curriculum. As always, everything's self-paced and freely available. And we are just getting started. There are so many math, computer science, and programming concepts we haven't covered yet. You can help.

Quote of the Week: “I refer to layers 1 through 4 of the OSI Model all the time. They’re a simplified and fairly easy way to understand the obtuse and arcane way modern networks are kludged together. It’s really hard to convey the layers necessary to do proper monitoring and detection without that understanding.” — Lesley Carhart, Security Researcher and Digital Forensics Expert

1. Unreal Engine is a powerful tool for coding your own video games. And with this GameDev course, you will learn how to use the Unreal Engine to build an "endless runner" game – complete with obstacles, hit detection, and a core gameplay loop. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-an-endless-runner-game-using-unreal-engine-and-c/

2. Binary Tree Algorithms come up all the time in developer job interviews. This course will help you understand common questions hiring managers may ask you about these data structures, and how to best answer them. You'll learn about Depth First, Breadth First, Max Root to Leaf Path Sum, and other core concepts. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-binary-tree-algorithms-in-technical-interviews/

3. When you visit a website like freeCodeCamp.org, your computer starts sending packets of data back and forth across the internet using the Internet Protocol. The IPv4 protocol came out way back in 1980, and gives every server its own 4-byte address. (That's 4 numbers between 0 and 255. For example, the localhost address: 127.0.0.1). But this only results in 4.3 billion possible combinations. And websites are already using almost all of these. Thankfully, the newer IPv6 protocol can save humanity from the threat of "address exhaustion". This article will show you how IPv6 works.

4. We teach React as part of freeCodeCamp's core curriculum. But a lot of developers also want to learn to use Angular. This course will teach you the Angular Front End Framework component system, lifecycle hooks, event binding, attribute directives, and other key concepts. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-angular-full-course/

5. Currying is a Functional Programming technique where you only pass one parameter to a function at a time, and then that function returns another function. This tutorial will show you how to compose Curried Functions so you can take your JavaScript skills to the next level.

7 years ago today, I deployed the first version of the freeCodeCamp.org website from my closet office. (Apartments in San Francisco are small, and that was the only quiet space I had to work in.) I wasn't sure if anyone else would find the website to be helpful. But a few people hung around on the forum and started contributing to the open source codebase. Today, the community helps more than half a million visitors each day. This is all possible thanks to the thousands of people who have contributed their talents or made donations to our nonprofit. And we are just getting started. There is so much work still to be done. So many math and programming concepts we want to teach the world. If you want to get involved, the easiest way you can help is to donate to support our nonprofit's mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-donate-to-free-code-camp/
